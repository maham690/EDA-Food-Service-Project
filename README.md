# EDA on Food Service Data 

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a food service dataset to identify patterns related to kitchen operations, staff, weather conditions, and food waste.

##  Objective
To analyze operational efficiency and food waste trends, and provide actionable insights using data visualization and statistical methods.

##  Dataset Features
- Meals served per day
- Kitchen staff count
- Temperature and humidity
- Special events
- Staff experience
- Food waste and waste categories

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Findings
- More kitchen staff may increase food waste due to overproduction.
- Special event days lead to higher food waste.
- Some correlation exists between temperature and waste levels.
